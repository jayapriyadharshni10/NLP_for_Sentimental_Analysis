Sentiment Analysis using NLP (TextBlob)

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to determine whether the sentiment is Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically the TextBlob library, to calculate sentiment polarity. The results are visualized using a simple bar chart with matplotlib.

Project Files
- reviews.csv – Sample input dataset with customer reviews
- sentiment_analysis.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with the complete implementation (Google Colab-ready)
- sentiment_output.csv – Output file with added sentiment labels
- Sentiment_Analysis_NLP_Project.docx – A detailed project report (with explanations and code)
- README.md – This file

Technologies & Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- Google Colab (for development)

Sample Output

| Review                     | Sentiment |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| This phone is great!       | Positive  |
| Worst experience ever      | Negative  |
| It was okay                | Neutral   |

Visual Output
The sentiment distribution is plotted as a bar graph to show the number of reviews in each category.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how simple NLP tools like TextBlob can be used to analyze and interpret customer opinions. It can be scaled further for analyzing product reviews, tweets, or any kind of user feedback in real time.
